# KepaThreat
This is a newly developed software application, KepaThreat, that is used to search for harmful files or directories that may contain malware. KepaThreat functions similarly to an antivirus program in that it searches users' computers for potentially harmful files. In-depth scanning is provided by KepaThreat, which enables users to select any specific folder for scanning. This helps users identify and deal with any suspicious files that are found.
